# WikipediaWebCrawler
This is a project that I created in Python for my Data Mining class. 
I created a web crawler using Scrapy to perform a bredth first search on 1000 wikipedia pages.
My starting page was the Computer science wikipedia page. The goal of th project was to extract the most important computer science topics. 
To process my data, I removed all leftover html elements, removed all stopwords from the NLTK stopwords library, tokenized my words, stemmed my words, and removed punctuation.
